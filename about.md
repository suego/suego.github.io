  <h2>Investing in People and Ideas That Can Change the World</h2>
  <blockquote><h4>SUEGO is not a conventional company. Its focus is to explore complex problems for high impact solutions. - Steven A. Rodriguez, Managing Director &amp; Founder, SUEGO</h4></blockquote>
  <p>SUEGO is a content platform designed to mobilize the mindset and culture of entrepreneurship, as well as to develop skills and abilities for entrepreneurs, helping to break down barriers in the creation and growth of companies through the crowdsourcing of knowledge and entrepreneurship. It is focused on potential and current entrepreneurs, teachers, students and anyone interested in learning.</p>
  <h2>Corporate Impact &amp; Social Responsibility</h2>
  <p>We foster a #GiveFirst culture as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, working with partners worldwide to break down barriers to economic opportunity, help people lift themselves out of poverty, and deliver sustainable and inclusive growth that benefits everyone.</p>
  <p>We started with partnering with diverse organizations to provide Technical Assistance around digital marketing for diverse small businesses who are unable to leverage or afford it. Our partners range from small nonprofits like <a href="https://project500.org" target="_blank">Project 500 DC</a> to mid and higher tier organizations like the <a href="https://gwhcc.org" target="_blank">Greater Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.ledcmetro.org" target="_blank">Latino Economic Development Center</a>.</p>
  <p>We partner with companies to reduce barriers and provide equal access and opportunities for new majority communities (traditionally underrepresented groups), with a focus on people with disabilities. Our partners range from local startups like <a href="https://www.texiles.com" target="_blank">Texiles</a> in Washington, D.C. to cross-border companies like <a href="http://www.orangeup.org" target="_blank">OrangeUp S.A.S.</a> in Bogota, Colombia.</p>
  <p>We have a strong commitment to our clients worldwide and their communities. The team will do our best to make SUEGO a force for good and the world a better place.</p>
